This project is an AI-powered Tic Tac Toe game that I developed using machine learning techniques. The game offers an interactive and challenging experience by leveraging AI algorithms to adapt to various gaming strategies. Through this project, I aimed to showcase the fusion of artificial intelligence and gaming, allowing users to play against an intelligent opponent. The game's design emphasizes a user-friendly interface and an AI that adjusts its gameplay, providing an engaging and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels.

To run the game, run the file named 'Game.py'.
