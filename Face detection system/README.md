Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform face detection on an input image, highlighting detected faces with bounding rectangles. To use the script, ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed on your machine. Clone the repository, run the script, and the output will display the original image alongside the same image with outlined faces. The code employs a Haar Cascade classifier for face detection, with parameters such as scaleFactor and minNeighbors adjustable for different scenarios. Feel free to customize the script for your specific use case or explore other Haar Cascade classifier files for various objects.
